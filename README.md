#Farhang

Farhang is a dictionary app based on Sinatra and MongoDB. 

It runs on MRI 1.8, 1.9, JRuby in 1.8 and 1.9 mode and on Rubinius 1.8 mode. Due to some encoding issues it doesn't yet work in 1.9 mode.

Farhang has a simple interface, role based editing and a moderation system for changed entries. 

See it in action with the original German-Persian dictionary at http://www.farhang.im 

If you want to run your own instance of Farhang make sure to rename `config-example.rb` to `config.rb` and use your own values.
